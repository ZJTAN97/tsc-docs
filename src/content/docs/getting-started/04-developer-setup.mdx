import { Code, Badge } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## 1. Clone Repository

You can clone the repository from this [link](gitlab-link) using

- SSH when you set up your gitlab API key
- HTTPS using your redwood account login.

<Code code={`git clone https://gitlab-link`} lang="bash" title="bash" />

## 2. Development Environment

You will have to minimally install the following to get started. Click on the links to navigate to the right place in artifactory to get the necesary software.

1. [Visual Studio Code]()
2. [NodeJS]() Minimally `v20.13.x`
3. [Git]()

Once you have the above installed, setup `PNPM`

<Code code={`npm i -g pnpm`} lang="bash" title="bash" />

Ensure that the installed version is at least `10.13.x`

<Code code={`pnpm --version`} lang="bash" title="bash" />

The following are optional, but could potentially help in your development experience.

- GUI for managing Git
  - [Github Desktop]()
  - [Git Extensions]()
- [Docker]()
- [Kubectl]()
- [Helm]()
- [IntelliJ]()

## 3. Setting up Visual Studio Code

Install the required extensions, you may have noticed the extensions suggestions when you open VSCode within the project.

Either click on the install button or make sure to install the following extensions yourself. This step is highly recommended to ensure optimal developer experience.

1. Biome
2. CSS Variable Autocomplete
3. GitLens
4. NX Console
5. Pretty TypeScript Errors
6. Playwright Test for VSCode

Open up the project with Visual Studio Code and using the terminal of your choice, run the following command

<Code code={`pnpm install`} lang="bash" title="bash" />

This will install all the required dependencies required to run any node based projects within the mono-repository, excluding [`common-service`](https://link-to-it).

## 4. Starting a Project

Please refer to the following documentations for a full list of commands and actions you can run on for a specific project.

- [Entity Dossier]()
- [Digital Production]()
- [Search]()
- [Workspace]()
- [Raw Management | <Badge text="Coming Soon!" variant="note" />]()

## 5. (Optional) Configuring your Node to point to Artifactory with SSL setup

Because we are working on-premise with our own NPM artifactory, we will need to configure our package installers such as `npm` and `pnpm` to point towards our own artifactory.

Run the following commands

```bash
EXPORT ...
EXPORT ...
```

This will ensure that your package installers can point to the correct artifactory even if its ran outside of this mono-repository project.
