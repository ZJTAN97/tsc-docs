TSC today serves as a one-stop platform, enabling users to effortlessly connect with a variety of data stores and providing a comprehensive suite of tools designed to support analytical and sensemaking work.
Our goal at TSC is to be a go-to smart platform, dedicated to enhancing collaboration and integrating data and knowledge across our organization.

We strive to help users generate meaningful insights and improve operational efficiency. With TSC, we empower our users to not just manage data but also leveraging a powerful resource to make sense of the available data and achieve better mission outcome for our organization.

## Design Philosophy

:::note
Core Design Philosophy: Simplicity and Developer Autonomy
:::

The architectural design approach is grounded in the principle of simplicity. We deliberately seek the simplest viable solutions, leveraging on proven tools and minimizing unnecessary abstractions. Simple architectures are easier to communicate, build, deploy, operate and evolve,
and they better foster a common and shared understanding across teams. This clarity not only accelerates development but also reduces operational risks and maintenance overhead.

## Developer Autonomy

Developer autonomy is a central tenent. By avoiding over-engineering and excessive constraints, we empower developers to explore, understand and contribute meaningfully to the TSC eco system. This autonomy encourages continuous learning, innovation and ownership, leading to better solutions and a more resilient architecture.

## Simplicity

We recognise that achieving simplicity is an ongoing effort. It requires discipline, clear communication and regular review to avoid complexity and messy requirements creeping in over time. Our philosophy is to embrace change, iterate based on feedback and prioritize solutions that are easy to understand and adapt.
